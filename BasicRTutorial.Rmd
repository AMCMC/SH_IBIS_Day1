# Data Structures in R
Data structures are ways of organizing data in R. The most common structures include:

Vectors
A vector is a one-dimensional array that holds elements of the same type.

```{r}
# Numeric vector
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numeric_vector

# Character vector
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
character_vector
```

Data Frames
A data frame is a table or a 2D array-like structure where each column can contain a different type.

```{r}
# Create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"),
  score = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
)
df
```

Lists

A list is a flexible structure that can hold objects of different types.

```{r}
# Create a list
my_list <- list(name = "Alice", age = 25, scores = c(95, 80, 85))
my_list
```

Matrices

A matrix is a 2D array where all elements must be of the same type.

```{r}
# Create a matrix
matrix_data <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
matrix_data
```

Factors

Factors are used for categorical data and can have levels.

```{r}
# Create a factor
factor_data <- factor(c("High", "Low", "Medium", "High"))
factor_data
```

# R Workspace

The Environment in R includes the workspace where objects (such as data frames, functions, and variables) are stored. Understanding how to manage your R environment can help avoid conflicts and keep your workspace clean.

Key Environment Functions

ls(): Lists all objects in the current environment.
rm(object_name): Removes a specific object.
rm(list = ls()): Clears all objects in the environment.
RStudio Environment Panel: Lists all objects visually (in RStudio only).
Example:

```{r}
# List all objects in the environment
ls()

# Create a sample object
my_data <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = letters[1:5])

# Remove an object
rm(my_data)
```

Tip: Use the Environment tab in RStudio to see objects, clear variables, and manage your workspace easily.

# Functions

There are many functions available in base R which can be used for data manipulation, statistical testing and visualization.

```{r}
Sys.Date()
```

Perform a function on columns or rows of a matrix.

```{r}
matrix_data
apply(matrix_data, 1, max)
apply(matrix_data, 2, max)
```

Basic Visualization

```{r}
barplot(df$score, names.arg = df$name)
```

You can get information by preceding a function with a question mark.
You should see a description popup in the Help pane.

```{r, eval=F}
?prcomp()
```

The most common used base functions in R are:

```{r, eval=F}
c() #Combine values into a vector or list.
seq(): #Generate sequences of numbers.
rep(): #Repeat elements.
length() #Get the length of an object.
sort(), order(), rank() #Sort, order, or rank elements.
unique(): #Find unique elements in a vector.
table(): # Create a frequency table of a variable.
match() # Get positions of a variable in vector in a second vector
```

# Phyloseq: Working with Microbial Data

Besides base R functions, libraries with more specific functions can be installed and loaded into the environment. On such a library is Phyloseq, which has multiple functions for handling and analyzing microbiome data. Itâ€™s commonly used for data from amplicon sequencing studies  and can store taxonomic, phylogenetic, and abundance data in one object.

## Basic Phyloseq Usage

A Phyloseq object typically consists of several components:

otu_table: Stores the abundance data (OTU or ASV table).
sample_data: Contains metadata for each sample.
tax_table: Holds taxonomic information.
phy_tree: Stores the phylogenetic tree.

```{r} 
library(phyloseq)

# Load a sample dataset included with phyloseq
data(GlobalPatterns)

# Subset the data (e.g., only samples from a specific environment)
subset_data <- subset_samples(GlobalPatterns, SampleType == "Feces")

# Calculate alpha diversity
alpha_diversity <- estimate_richness(subset_data, measures = c("Shannon", "Observed"))
alpha_diversity
```

# Tidyverse: Data Manipulation and Transformation

The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages for data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization. It includes popular packages such as dplyr (data manipulation), tidyr (data reshaping), and ggplot2 (data visualization).

## Key Tidyverse Functions
Using dplyr for Data Manipulation
filter(): Select rows based on conditions.
select(): Choose specific columns.
mutate(): Add or modify columns.
summarize(): Aggregate data.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"),
  score = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
)
```

```{r}
# Filter rows where score > 25
df_filtered <- df %>% filter(score > 25)
df_filtered

# Add a new column
df_mutated <- df %>% mutate(score_squared = score^2)
df_mutated

# Summarize the data
df_summary <- df %>% summarize(mean_score = mean(score))
df_summary
```

# ggplot2: Data Visualization
ggplot2 is part of the Tidyverse and is a powerful system for creating visualizations.

Basic Syntax
In ggplot2, plots are built by layering components:

ggplot(data): Initializes the plot with data.
aes(x, y): Defines aesthetics, like x and y axes, but also variable used for coloring, grouping etc. 
geom_*(): Adds different plot types, like points, lines, and bars.
Example Plotting Workflow

```{r}
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(
  category = c("A", "B", "C"),
  value = c(3, 5, 2)
)

# Basic bar plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = category, y = value)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Bar Plot Example", x = "Category", y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal() +
  NULL # added for easy commenting or unmommenting previous layers
```

Plotting Phyloseq Data with ggplot2
Phyloseq has functions that integrate with ggplot2, allowing easy visualization of microbiome data.

```{r}
phyloseq::plot_richness(GlobalPatterns, measures = "Shannon", x = "SampleType")
```

But data can also easily be converted into a dataframe using 'psmelt'

```{r}
# Transform phyloseq data to a format that ggplot2 can use
phyloseq_data <- prune_taxa(names(sort(taxa_sums(GlobalPatterns), decreasing = T)[1:6]), GlobalPatterns) %>% psmelt() 

# Create a box plot of abundance by sample type
ggplot(phyloseq_data, aes(x = SampleType, y = Abundance)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() + 
  labs(title = "Microbial Abundance by Sample Type") +
  facet_wrap(~OTU, scales="free") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  NULL
```

This guide should provide a good foundation for basic R usage, including handling the environment, using core data structures, analyzing microbiome data with Phyloseq, transforming data with Tidyverse, and creating visualizations with ggplot2. Practice and exploration will help solidify these skills!
